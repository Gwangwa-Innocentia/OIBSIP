 <h2>Biography</h2>
 <p>1. Early Life and Education
Birth: Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. He was the first child of Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch.
Childhood: Einstein's early years were marked by curiosity but also challenges. He didn’t speak until the age of three, which led to some concern. However, he showed an early fascination with science, particularly with a compass his father showed him.
Education: Einstein attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich and later the Luitpold Gymnasium. He excelled in mathematics but had conflicts with the rigid schooling system. At 15, he left school to join his family in Italy and eventually enrolled in the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, where he studied physics and mathematics. <br>
2. Early Career and the Annus Mirabilis
Early Struggles: After graduating in 1900, Einstein struggled to find a teaching position and worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland. During this period, he continued his scientific work in his spare time.
1905: Annus Mirabilis (Miracle Year): In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers in the Annalen der Physik, a leading scientific journal. These papers covered the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc²). This year marked Einstein’s emergence as a significant figure in the scientific community. <br>
3. Major Scientific Contributions
Theory of Special Relativity: Published in 1905, this theory revolutionized the understanding of space and time, leading to the famous equation E=mc², which established the relationship between mass and energy.
General Theory of Relativity: Published in 1915, this theory extended special relativity and introduced the concept of spacetime being curved by gravity. It predicted phenomena such as the bending of light by gravity, which was confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919.
Quantum Theory and the Photoelectric Effect: Einstein’s work on the photoelectric effect, explaining how light can eject electrons from a material, was pivotal in the development of quantum mechanics and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. <br>
4. Personal Life
Family: Einstein married Mileva Marić, a fellow student at the Polytechnic, in 1903. They had two sons, Hans Albert and Eduard. The marriage was strained, and they divorced in 1919. Later that year, Einstein married his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, who supported him through his later years.
Character and Beliefs: Einstein was known for his pacifism, humanism, and advocacy for civil rights. He was an outspoken critic of nationalism and militarism, especially during World War I. He was also deeply concerned about the ethical implications of scientific discoveries, particularly in the context of nuclear weapons. <br>
5. Later Years and Legacy
Move to the United States: With the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany, Einstein, who was Jewish, emigrated to the United States in 1933. He accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he spent the rest of his life.
World War II and the Manhattan Project: Although Einstein was a pacifist, he signed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939, warning of the potential for Nazi Germany to develop atomic weapons. This letter contributed to the establishment of the Manhattan Project. However, Einstein was not directly involved in the project and later expressed regret over the use of atomic bombs.
Death: Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 76. His brain was preserved for study, leading to ongoing research into the neurological basis of his genius. <br>
6. Contributions to Science and Humanity
Impact on Physics: Einstein’s theories transformed our understanding of the universe, influencing not just physics but also philosophy, cosmology, and technology. His work laid the groundwork for much of modern theoretical physics, including quantum mechanics and cosmology.
Cultural Legacy: Einstein became a cultural icon, representing both intellectual achievement and moral responsibility. His image, with his unruly hair and thoughtful expression, has become synonymous with genius. <br>
7. Honors and Memorials
Nobel Prize: Received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
Global Recognition: Numerous awards, honorary degrees, and commemorations worldwide. His name is synonymous with intellectual brilliance, and his work continues to inspire scientific inquiry and philosophical debate. <br>
8. Influence on Modern Science
Ongoing Relevance: Einstein’s work continues to influence modern physics, including research in black holes, quantum field theory, and cosmology. The concept of relativity remains central to understanding the universe.
